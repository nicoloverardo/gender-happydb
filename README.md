# Gender prediction from moments of happiness
Project 2 for the Machine Learning exam.

In this project we address a classification problem on the HappyDB dataset. Our goal is to check if we can predict the gender from textual data expressing happiness. We will pre-process the text of the happy moments and then implement few algorithms such as Support Vector
Machines, Convolutional Neural Network and fastText, and compare their accuracy through a 5-fold cross validation.
